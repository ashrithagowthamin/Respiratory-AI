# 🫁 Respiratory AI — Clinical-Grade Diagnostic System

> **Advanced AI-powered screening platform for respiratory health.** Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) and EfficientNet-B0 to provide rapid, accurate, and explainable analysis of lung sounds.

---

## 📋 Overview

Respiratory AI is a professional diagnostic screening platform designed to bridge the gap between complex acoustic signal processing and clinical decision-making. By utilizing a **dual-stage training pipeline** (SSL Pre-training + Supervised Fine-tuning), the system achieves robust pattern recognition even in noisy clinical environments.

### 🌟 Key Capabilities
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provides technical rationales for every diagnostic result.
- **Low-Latency Engine**: Optimized for sub-2-second inference using multi-threaded execution.
- **High-Fidelity Signal Processing**: Butterworth filtering and Mel-spectrogram heatmaps for visual verification.
- **Localization**: Full support for English, Spanish, Hindi, and Telugu.
- **Clinical Reporting**: Automated PDF generation with clinical verification signatures and specialist recommendations.

## ✨ Features & Architecture

### 🏥 Clinical Intelligence Grid
| Feature | Technical Implementation | Clinical Value |
|---------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **4-Class Detection** | EfficientNet-B0 + CrossEntropy | Categorizes sounds into Normal, Wheeze, Crackle, or Mixed. |
| **Acoustic Heatmaps** | Librosa + DB-scale Mel-spectrograms | Visualizes the "fingerprint" of the respiratory sound. |
| **Insight Engine** | Severity mapping & Urgency logic | Translates raw AI data into actionable medical insights. |
| **Live Oscilloscope** | Web Audio API AnalyserNode | Real-time feedback during audio recording. |

### 🤖 Training Pipeline (SSL)
The system uses **SimCLR-style Contrastive Learning** to learn robust features from unlabeled audio before being fine-tuned on the gold-standard ICBHI 2017 dataset.

1. **Stage 1 (Pre-training)**: Learns acoustic representations via noise injection and frequency masking.
2. **Stage 2 (Fine-tuning)**: Adapts the encoder for specific respiratory disease classification.
